# iHum: Your Musical Journey Begins with a Hum

## The Power of an Idea

When you have an idea, what’s the first thing you do? Do you ask someone, write it down, or research it? You externalize the intangible thought so you don't forget. The problem is, an idea is finicky, and time is the enemy. If you don’t capture the accuracy of your idea, it can be gone in seconds.

### The Challenge

Imagine a water balloon. This is our highly intellectual brains, our gift to create. But if you don’t know how to play an instrument, use a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), or extract your musical thoughts fast enough out of your brain, your confidence, idea, and passion get depleted until they’re gone.

## Welcome to iHum

Welcome to iHum, where your musical journey begins with a hum. Our innovative AI application transforms your vocal melodies into instruments, allowing you to create music effortlessly and fast.

### Target Audience

The fastest-growing group of music makers is between 18 and 34 years old. Why? Because the youth don't have the knowledge, and adults beyond 34 years old don't have the time. Thus, this is a mini DAW targeting these demographics for fast music development to help aspiring artists develop their passions with a fast and user-friendly music creation tool.

- **82%** wish they had learned to play a musical instrument.
- **67%** expressed an interest in learning to do so.

iHum increases equity for families that can't afford instruments and lessons, allowing their children to explore their musical inclinations. You don’t have to know how to play an instrument or use a DAW.

## Our Solution

### Design

Our users, particularly youth, need simplicity and action. Our simple page design directly takes the user to the recording stage with preset instruments available to transform hums into instruments.

### Business Practicality

#### Proof of Concept

Let’s look at these statistics:

- **27%** of parents want their children involved in music but can't afford it due to the astronomical music costs and restricted incomes.
- **82%** of kids want to learn and express their musicality, and most children utilize singing as their instrument of choice.

By utilizing our application of voice-converted instruments, we allow the youth to combat these challenges. There's equity in our melody: iHum unleashes musical potential for everyone.

## Democratizing Music Production

Our iHum tool aims to democratize music production, making it accessible to everyone, particularly youth and those without formal music training.

### Addressing Complexity

Many aspiring musicians and hobbyists find Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) like Logic Pro, Ableton, and FL Studio daunting due to their complexity. These DAWs offer features that convert audio waveforms into piano notes, which are popular among professional music producers, but are underutilized by newcomers due to their steep learning curves and high upfront costs.

### Our Unique Offering

Our AI Vocal to MIDI Converter stands out by offering an intuitive and user-friendly solution tailored specifically for beginners and non-musicians. Unlike traditional DAWs, our application focuses on simplicity and ease of use, enabling users to quickly convert their vocal ideas into MIDI without needing extensive technical knowledge.

### The Promise

Import a hum, export a song. Guaranteed you’ve never seen that before.
