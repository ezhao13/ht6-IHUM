      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p>Welcome to iHum, where your musical journey begins with a hum. Our innovative AI application
transforms your vocal melodies into MIDI instruments, allowing you to create music effortlessly,
even if you don't know how to play an instrument or use digital audio workstation (DAW)
software.</p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>We aim to inspire and empower a new generation of music creators. Our product is designed for
those who have a passion for music but lack the knowledge, resources, or time to create it
traditionally. With iHum, we break down the barriers to music creation, making it accessible,
fast, and affordable for everyone. iHum targets the fastest-growing group of music makers, ages 18 to 34. Youth often lack the
knowledge to create music, while those beyond 34 may not have the time. Our mini DAW
solution offers a fast, user-friendly platform that helps aspiring and emerging artists develop
their passions.</p>
